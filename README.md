Welcome to the Amazon Clone project! This is a simple yet effective replica of Amazon’s homepage built using HTML and CSS. Please note that this project is a static, non-responsive version, focusing on layout and design rather than functionality and responsiveness.

Project Overview
This project aims to replicate the visual appearance of Amazon’s homepage, providing a clear example of how to structure and style web pages using fundamental web technologies. While it does not include advanced features like responsiveness or interactivity, it serves as a solid foundation for understanding basic web design principles.# Amazon-Clone #html #css
